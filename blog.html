			<h2>Question - 1. The differences among map(), filter(), forEach() and find</h2>
			<p class="text-xl mt-5 ml-5">
				In JavaScript, map(), filter(), forEach(), and find() are four commonly used array methods that help
				developers manipulate and work with arrays. Here's a detailed comparison of these four methods:<br> <br>

				i. map(): The map() method is used to create a new array by performing an operation on each element of
				an
				existing array. The resulting array will have the same length as the original array. It returns a new
				array without modifying the original array.<br>

				ii. filter(): The filter() method is used to create a new array by filtering out elements from an
				existing array that don't meet a certain condition. The resulting array may have a different length than
				the original array. It returns a new array without modifying the original array. <br>

				iii. forEach(): The forEach() method is used to iterate over an array and perform an operation on each
				element. It doesn't return a new array and instead modifies the original array. <br>

				iv. find(): The find() method is used to find the first element in an array that meets a certain
				condition. It returns the first matching element or undefined if no element is found.<br>

				In summary, map() is used to transform an array, filter() is used to filter an array, forEach() is used
				to loop over an array and execute a function for each element, and find() is used to find the first
				element in an array that meets a certain condition.

			<h2>Question - 2. Differences among Local Storage, Session Storage And Cookies.</h2>
			<p class="text-xl mt-5 ml-5">
				Local Storage, Session Storage, and Cookies are all ways to store data within the user's browser, but
				they differ in their scope, persistence, and purpose. <br>

				Local Storage: The data stored in Local Storage persists even after the user closes the browser or shuts
				down the computer. The data is stored in the user's browser and can be accessed by any page in the same
				domain. The data is available until the user manually clears it or the web application deletes it. Local
				Storage is designed for long-term storage of data that needs to persist across sessions. <br>

				Session Storage: The data stored in Session Storage is only available for the duration of the user's
				browser session. The data is stored in the user's browser and can be accessed by any page in the same
				domain. Once the user closes the browser or shuts down the computer, the data is automatically cleared.
				Session Storage is designed for short-term storage of data that needs to be cleared when the user closes
				the browser. <br>

				Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are stored on the user's computer by the web browser. They
				can be used to store user preferences, login information, and other data. Cookies can be set to expire
				after a certain period of time or when the user closes the browser. Cookies can be accessed by any page
				on the same domain that sets the cookie. Cookies are typically used for maintaining user sessions and
				storing user preferences. <br>
				<br>
				Finally we ca say, Local Storage and Session Storage are used for storing data within the user's
				browser,
				accessible by any page in the same domain, with Local Storage designed for long-term storage and Session
				Storage designed for short-term storage. Cookies are also used for storing data within the user's
				browser but are typically used for maintaining user sessions and storing user preferences. Cookies can
				also be set to expire after a certain period of time or when the user closes the browser.

			<h2>Question - 3. What is event loop in JavaScript and how does it works?</h2>
			<p class="text-xl mt-5 ml-5">
				In JavaScript, the event loop is a mechanism that manages the execution of code by continuously
				monitoring the call stack and the task queue. The event loop allows JavaScript to be single-threaded
				while still being able to handle asynchronous code execution, such as event handlers, timers, and
				callbacks. <br>

				The event loop works as follows: <br>

				i. The JavaScript engine starts by executing the code on the main thread and pushing it onto the call
				stack. <br>

				ii. If the code encounters an asynchronous operation, such as a timer or a network request, it will be
				removed from the call stack and added to the task queue. <br>

				iii. The event loop continuously monitors the call stack and the task queue. When the call stack is empty,
				the event loop will take the first task from the task queue and push it onto the call stack. <br>

				iv. The code in the task is then executed, and any new asynchronous operations are added to the task queue. <br>

				v. This process repeats continuously, allowing JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations while still
				being single-threaded.
