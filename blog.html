			Past</h2>
		<div class="font-semibold text-2xl mt-10 ml-10">
			<h2 class="text-violet-400">Question - 1. What is the differences among map(), filter(), forEach() and find?
			</h2>
			<p class="text-xl mt-5 ml-5">
				In JavaScript, map(), filter(), forEach(), and find() are four commonly used array methods that help
				developers to manipulate and work with arrays. Here's a detailed comparison of these four methods:<br>
				<br>

				i. map(): The map() method is used to create a new array by performing an operation on each element of
				an existing array. It returns a new array without modifying the original array and the resulting array
				have same length as the original array.<br> <br>
				Example: <br>
				const array = ["Hafsa", "Jannat", "Tanjila"]; <br>
				const newArray = array.map((name) => name + " " + "Mridha" ); <br>

				console.log(array); <br>
				console.log(newArray); <br>

				Output : <br>
				[ 'Hafsa', 'Jannat', 'Tanjila' ] <br>
				[ 'Hafsa Mridha', 'Jannat Mridha', 'Tanjila Mridha' ] <br>

				Here the first output is out declared array and the second one is the array which we have created using
				map from the first one. Here at the time of creating second array, we have also concatenate string with
				the previous array's value but the declared array remain same and the modification is done in the second
				array.
				<br> <br>

				ii. filter(): The filter() method is used to create a new array by filtering out elements from an
				existing array that don't meet a certain condition. The resulting array may have a different length than
				the original array. It returns a new array without modifying the original array. <br> <br>
				Example: <br>
				const array = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]; <br>
				const newArr = array.filter((num) => num % 2 == 0); <br>
				console.log(array); <br>
				console.log(newArr); <br>
				Output: <br>
				[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] <br>
				[10, 12, 14] <br>

				From the above example it is clear that, the second array is the new creating array with the elements
				those meets the certain condition and the previous array is still remain same as before. <br> <br>

				iii. forEach(): The forEach() method is used to iterate over an array and perform an operation on each
				element of the array. It doesn't return a new array and instead modifies the original array. <br> <br>
				Example: <br>
				const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]; <br>
				arr.forEach((num) => console.log(num * 10)); <br>
				Output: <br>
				10 <br>
				20 <br>
				30 <br>
				40 <br>
				<br>
				iv. find(): The find() method is used to find the first element in an array that meets a certain
				condition. It returns the first matching element or undefined if no element is found.<br> <br>
				Example: <br>
				const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]; <br>
				const evenNum = array.find((num) => num % 2 == 0); <br>
				const oddNum = array.find((num) => num % 2!=0); <br>
				console.log(evenNum); <br>
				console.log(oddNum); <br>
				Output: <br>
				2 <br>
				1 <br> <br>
				From above discussion we can see, map() is used to create a new array by transforming or modifying values of te given array, filter() is used to filter an array with certain condition, forEach() is used to loop over an array and execute a function for every element, and find() is used to find the first element in an array that meets a certain condition.

			<h2 class="text-violet-400">Question - 2. What is the differences among Local Storage, Session Storage And
				Cookies?</h2>
			<p class="text-xl mt-5 ml-5">
				Local Storage, Session Storage, and Cookies are all ways to store data within the user's browser, but
				they differ in their scope, persistence, and purpose. <br> <br>

				Local Storage: The data stored in Local Storage persists even after the user closes the browser or shuts
				down the computer. The data is stored in the user's browser and can be accessed by any page in the same
				domain. The data is available until the user manually clears it or the web application deletes it. Local
				Storage is designed for long-term storage of data that needs to persist across sessions. <br> <br>

				Session Storage: The data stored in Session Storage is only available for the duration of the user's
				browser session. The data is stored in the user's browser and can be accessed by any page in the same
				domain. Once the user closes the browser or shuts down the computer, the data is automatically cleared.
				Session Storage is designed for short-term storage of data that needs to be cleared when the user closes
				the browser. <br> <br>

				Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are stored on the user's computer by the web browser. They
				can be used to store user preferences, login information, and other data. Cookies can be set to expire
				after a certain period of time or when the user closes the browser. Cookies can be accessed by any page
				on the same domain that sets the cookie. Cookies are typically used for maintaining user sessions and
				storing user preferences. <br>
				<br>
				Finally we can say, Local Storage and Session Storage are used for storing data within the user's
				browser, accessible by any page in the same domain, with Local Storage designed for long-term storage
				and Session Storage designed for short-term storage. Cookies are also used for storing data within the
				user's browser but are typically used for maintaining user sessions and storing user preferences.
				Cookies can also be set to expire after a certain period of time or when the user closes the browser.

			<h2 class="text-violet-400">Question - 3. What is the event loop in JavaScript and how does it works?</h2>
			<p class="text-xl mt-5 ml-5">
				In JavaScript, the event loop is a mechanism that manages the execution of code by continuously
				monitoring the call stack and the task queue. The event loop allows JavaScript to be single-threaded
				while still being able to handle asynchronous code execution, such as event handlers, timers, and
				callbacks. <br>

				The event loop works as follows: <br>

				i. The JavaScript engine starts by executing the code on the main thread and pushing it onto the call
				stack. <br>

				ii. If the code encounters an asynchronous operation, such as a timer or a network request, it will be
				removed from the call stack and added to the task queue. <br>

				iii. The event loop continuously monitors the call stack and the task queue. When the call stack is
				empty,
				the event loop will take the first task from the task queue and push it onto the call stack. <br>

				iv. The code in the task is then executed, and any new asynchronous operations are added to the task
				queue. <br>

				v. This process repeats continuously, allowing JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations while still
				being single-threaded.

			<h2 class="text-violet-400">Question - 4. What is the purpose of the function quizTimer()?</h2>
			<p class="text-xl mt-5 ml-5">
				The function quizTimer has only one parameter, 'dismiss'. This function's goal is to generate a quiz countdown timer. If the function returns true, it clears the interval timer and ends the countdown.Otherwise, it starts an interval timer and updates the timer display every second. The code within the interval timer function first picks an HTML element with the id "count" and then calculates the remaining minutes and seconds based on a variable named count. If required, the minutes and seconds are formatted with leading zeros before being shown within the specified HTML element. If the count variable is more than 60, the code alternates the color of the text displayed within the HTML element every two seconds by adding and deleting CSS classes. <br>
				Basically, this code is used to generate a quiz countdown timer with a visual display.

			<h2 class="text-violet-400">Question - 5. What is the purpose of the function chooseQuiz()?</h2>
			<p class="text-xl mt-5 ml-5">
				The chooseQuiz function requires two parameters, 'index' and 'givenAns'. The function's goal is to save
				the user's answer to a quiz question and update the list of answers accordingly. Using the array.find
				method, the function first determines if the solution to the current quiz question is already saved in
				the answers array. If the answer exists, it replaces the existing answer with the new one by using the for
				of loop to go over the answers array and identifying the matching answer object by using its id attribute.
				If the answer does not already exist in the answers array, the function produces a new answer object by
				dividing the quizData[index] object and adding the givenAns attribute. After updating the answers array,
				the function calls another function called displayAnswers using the answers array as an input.
				displayAnswers's goal is to refresh the user interface to show the current list of answers.
				<br>
				To summarize, this code allows the user to choose an answer to a quiz question and save it in an array.
				If the user changes their answer, the function updates the previously saved answer. The function also
				refreshes the user interface with the current set of replies.
